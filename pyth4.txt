# Fundamental coding with Python involving different constructs

# Variables
a = 5
b = 10

# Basic arithmetic operations
sum = a + b
difference = b - a
product = a * b
quotient = b / a

# Conditional statements
if sum > 20:
    result = "The sum is greater than 20."
elif sum == 20:
    result = "The sum is exactly 20."
else:
    result = "The sum is less than 20."

# Loops
for i in range(5):
    print("Loop iteration:", i)

# Functions
def greet(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

# Sample function call
greeting_message = greet("Alice")

# List comprehensions
squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]

# Printing results
print("Sum:", sum)
print("Difference:", difference)
print("Product:", product)
print("Quotient:", quotient)
print("Result:", result)
print("Greeting Message:", greeting_message)
print("Squares:", squares)
